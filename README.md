# Emacs Config

this is a long time emacs user's init file for data science and general AI engineering. This is established primarily for productivity gains across multiple OS enviornments including windows. 

### Tech required

here is a list of tech/software used for this

* [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - editor, need i say more!
* [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) - Get that Linux feeling! on Windows
* [python](https://www.python.org/) - when you have a hammer ...
* [Dilliger][dill] - when you are lazy at markdowns 

> Note to self:
> Improve this documentation!!!

# Windows!
Get cygwin! - native shell/bash control is considerably better than any of the other available tools (mysys, powershell or minigw). it needs minimal installation without the need for VM or vagrant based setups
* Here is what you will need - emacs-w32, fish, py3, numpy, boost, openssh, R, sqlalchemy, postgres, git, py3-pip, py3-setuptools, libboost, py3-wheel

# Emacs Essentials!
We will need all of these - *[ESS][ess], [Elpy][elpy], ido, [ample-zen][amplezen], [magit][magit], font:  [Mplus]([mplus])* 
Moving to Doom [doom]

### Todos
